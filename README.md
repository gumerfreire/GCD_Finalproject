--------

This project aims to process two different data sets to produce one tidy data set
containing the informaation of the initial two (train and test data sets).

The final table contains, apart from the variables, extra columns for subject and
activity identification. The output table has labels for the columns in order to
identify each feature. The codes for the activities are changed as well to introduce
the names in order to be better understandable.

The script is commented in each section. It comprises the following steps:

1. Load data
2. Add columns and join data from two different data sets
3. Assign column names and change variable names for readability
4. Summary and output

The output of the script is the file "TidyData.txt" which contains the complete
data set once processed.
